Node js consist of V8 engine and some super powers like APIs, Modules etc.

On server if there is node js it will run on V8 engine.

On client side the engine depends upon browser like:
Chrome => V8 engine
Internet Explorer => Chakra
etc..

Our V8 engine is almost 70% written on C++

Node JS almost 23% written on C++

Node Js also little bit written on C++ to emebed V8 engine.

we used C++ to write V8 engine because C++ is very close to low level language and low level language are very fast to run.

how code run on node repl;
1. create node repl => Run phase
2. Evaluate the code => Evaluate phase
3. Print the result => Print phase
4. then come to the inital stage => Loop
