var name = 'Ali';

output: undefined

Its because when our code execute, a execution context create. when our memory phase run it will store value of name : undefined. when our code phase run first it will console.log(name), 
then it will search in my meemory for name.then it will find name : undefined, so it will print undefined. but when var name = 'Ali' ran it will replace undefined to 'ALI'.
